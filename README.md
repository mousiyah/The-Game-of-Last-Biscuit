# The-Game-of-Last-Biscuit
The Game of Last Biscuit is a very simple variation of the very old Game of Nim. Like lots of games it comes in different versions. It’s essential that you follow the instructions here - not any others you might find or already know that are different because you are almost certain then to fail the automatic tests .

The game is for two players
Players take it in turns to play
The players has two barrels of biscuits (in our game, one will contain 6 biscuits and the other 8 biscuits)
Each player takes it in turn to take a number of biscuits 
They can take as many as they want BUT
They must EITHER take that number from ONE barrel
OR they must take the SAME number from BOTH barrels 
The player who takes the last biscuit wins .
The trick, obviously, to winning is not to leave your opponent with the same number of biscuits in both barrels and with at least one biscuit in each barrel.

Example - two barrels of 6 and 8 biscuits
Player 1 (who is not very clever) takes two biscuits from barrel 2

This leaves both barrels with 6 biscuits

Which means that Player 2 can take ALL the biscuits from both barrels - because there are the  same number in each.

So Player 2 wins

Example - two barrels of 6 and 8 biscuits
All our examples will have 6 and 8 because that’s what the coursework will be using

Player 1 takes 1 from barrel 1 (leaving 5 and 8)
Player 2 takes 4 from barrel 1 (leaving 1 and 8)
Player 1 takes 6 from barrel 2 (leaving 1 and 2)
Player 2 thinks carefully...
Player 2 realises that there are FOUR possible outcomes:
They could take 1 from barrel 2 - leaving 1 in each - so Player 1 will take both and win
They could take 2 from barrel 2 - leaving 1 in barrel 1- so Player 1 will take it and win
They could take the last one from barrel 1 - and Player 1 can take both from barrel 2 and win
They could take one from each barrel - leaving 1 in barrel 2 so Player 1 can take it and win
Player 2 cannot win..
Your task is to write an implementation for two human players who share the same computer and keyboard and take turns to play - there is no ‘AI’ in this.
